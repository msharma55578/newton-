            <a class="hyperlink"href https://projekt202.com/>projekt202</a>,
            Jared is capable within a wide range of tactical and big-picture design tasks. 
            <p class="headinbetween">A little bit more about Jared. Like anyone cares.</p>
            <p class="normal">Jared is passionate about making sure that systems, interfaces, language and graphics are human-friendly, emotive, aesthetically pleasing, clear, on-brand and usable â€” with a touch of mellow smoothness. 
              He has worked in a variety of environments, from mega-consultancies to small-ish agencies to product companies. 
              From workflow diagrams to detailed user interface mockups, Jared loves shaping and crafting on-screen experiences.
            
              <p class="normal">When Jared is not being a jerk by forgetting to label his Sketch layers, eating all the office candy, and showing up for work on time every day (so annoying), he enjoys never being satisfied with his own work, 
                photography, movies, gardening, toast, and occasionally throwing down in fisticuffs with CSS.
